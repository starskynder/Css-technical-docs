              CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc. A document is
              usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you will
              also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML. Presenting a document to a user means converting
              it into a usable form for your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer, are designed
              to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer. Web browsers apply
              CSS rules to a document to affect how they are displayed. A CSS rule is formed from:
              <ul>
                <li>A set of properties, which have values set to update how the HTML content is displayed, for example I
                  want my element's width to be 50% of its parent element, and its background to be red.</li>
                <li>A selector, which selects the element(s) you want to apply the updated property values to. For example,
                  I want to apply my CSS rule to all the paragraphs in my HTML document.</li>
              </ul>


              A set of CSS rules contained within a stylesheet determines how a webpage should look.
              <span class="doc-card__snippet">
                <code class="doc-card_example">
           
h1 {<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;color: blue;<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;background-color: yellow;<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;border: 1px solid black;<br>
 &nbsp;}<br>
<br>
p {<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;color: red;<br>
  &nbsp;}
</code> </span>
              The first rule starts with an h1 selector, which means that it will apply its property values to the
              <span class="tags">&lt;h1&gt;</span> element. It contains three properties and their values (each property/value
              pair is called a declaration):
              <ul>
                <li>The first one sets the text color to blue.</li>
                <li> The second sets the background color to yellow.</li>
                <li> The third one puts a border around the header that is 1 pixel wide, solid (not dotted, or dashed, etc.),
                  and colored black.
                </li>
              </ul>
              The second rule starts with a <span class="tags">p</span> selector, which means that it will apply its property
              values to the <span class="tags"> &lt;p&gt; </span>element. It contains one declaration, which sets the text
              color to red.

              When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information. It processes the document
              in two stages:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The browser converts HTML and CSS into the DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer's
                  memory. It combines the document's content with its style.</li>
                <li> The browser displays the contents of the DOM.</li>
              </ul>
              A DOM has a tree-like structure. Each element, attribute and piece of text in the markup language becomes a DOM node in the
              tree structure. The nodes are defined by their relationship to other DOM nodes. Some elements are parents of
              child nodes, and child nodes have siblings. Understanding the DOM helps you design, debug and maintain your
              CSS because the DOM is where your CSS and the document's content meet up.<br> Rather than a long,
              boring explanation, let's take an example to see how the DOM and CSS work together. Let's assume the following
              HTML code:
              <span class="doc-card__snippet">
                <code>
               &lt;p&gt;<br>
                  Let's use: <br>
                  &nbsp;&lt;span&gt;Cascading&lt;/span&gt; <br>
                  &nbsp;&lt;span&gt;Style&lt;/span&gt; <br>
                  &nbsp;&lt;span&gt;Sheets&lt;/span&gt; <br>
               &lt;/p&gt;
              </code>
              </span>
              In the DOM, the node corresponding to our <span class="tags">&lt;p&gt;</span> element is a parent. Its children
              are a text node and the nodes corresponding to our <span class="tags">&lt;span&gt; </span> elements. The SPAN
              nodes are also parents, with text nodes as their children:
              <span class="doc-card__snippet">
                <code>
                  P<br>
├─ "Let's use:"<br>
├─ SPAN<br>

├─ SPAN<br>

              There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across, some more useful than others.
              Here we'll briefly review each one.
              <span class="secondary-title">External stylesheet</span> An external stylesheet is when you have your CSS written
              in a separate file with a <b>.css</b> extension, and you reference it from an HTML
              <span class="tags">&lt;link&gt;</span> element. The HTML file looks something like this:
              <span class="doc-card__snippet">
                <code>
                      &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; <br>
                      &nbsp;&lt;html&gt;<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;head&gt;<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;<br>
                      &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;title&gt;My CSS experiment&lt;/title&gt;<br>
                      &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;<br>
                      &nbsp;&lt;/head&gt;<br>
                      &lt;body&gt;<br>
                      &nbsp; &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
                      &nbsp; &lt;p&gt;This is my first CSS example&lt;/p&gt;<br>
                        &lt;/body&gt;<br>
                      &lt;/html&gt;
                  </code>
              </span>
              And the CSS file:
              <span class="doc-card__snippet">
                <code>
                  h1 { <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; color: blue; <br>
                   &nbsp; &nbsp;background-color: yellow; <br>
                   &nbsp; &nbsp;border: 1px solid black; <br>
                  } <br>
                  <br>
                  p {<br>
                    &nbsp;  &nbsp; color: red;<br>
                  }
                </code>
              </span>
              This method is arguably the best, as you can use one stylesheet to style multiple documents, and would only need to update
              the CSS in one place if changes were needed.
              <span class="secondary-title">Internal Stylesheet</span>
              An internal stylesheet is where you don't have an external CSS file, but instead place your CSS inside a <span
                class="tags">&lt;style&gt;</span> element, contained inside the HTML head. So the HTML would look like this:
              <span class="doc-card__snippet">
                <code>
                    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; <br>
&lt;html&gt; <br>
&nbsp;&lt;head&gt; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title>My CSS experiment&lt;/title&gt; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;style&gt; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;h1 { <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: blue; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: yellow; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;border: 1px solid black; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;p { <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: red; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;} <br>
  &nbsp;&lt;/style&gt; <br>
&lt;/head&gt; <br>
&lt;body&gt; <br>
&nbsp;&lt;h1>Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt; <br>
&nbsp;&lt;p>This is my first CSS example&lt;/p&gt; <br>
&lt;/body&gt; <br>
&lt;/html&gt; <br>
                  </code>
              </span>
              This can be useful in some circumstances (maybe you're working with a content management system where you can't modify the
              CSS files directly), but it isn't quite as efficient as external stylesheets — in a website, the CSS would
              need to be repeated across every page, and updated in multiple places if changes were required.
              <span class="secondary-title">Inline Styles</span>
              <span class="doc-card__snippet"><code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; <br>
&lt;html&gt; <br>
&nbsp;&lt;head&gt; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title>My CSS experiment&lt;/title&gt; <br>
&nbsp;&lt;/head&gt; <br>
&lt;body&gt; <br>
&nbsp;&lt;h1 style="color: blue;background-color: yellow;border: 1px solid black;"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt; <br>
&nbsp;&lt;p style="color:red;">This is my first CSS example&lt;/p&gt; <br>
&lt;/body&gt; <br>
&lt;/html&gt; <br>
              </code></span>
              Please don't do this, unless you really have to! It is really bad for maintenance (you might have to update the same information
              multiple times per document), and it also mixes your presentational CSS information with your HTML structural
              information, making the CSS harder to read and understand. Keeping your different types of code separated and
              pure makes for a much easier job for all who work on the code. <br> <br>The only time you might
              have to resort to using inline styles is when your working environment is really restrictive (perhaps your
              CMS only allows you to edit the HTML body.)

              At its most basic level, CSS consists of two building blocks:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Properties: Human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features (e.g. font, width, background color) you want
                  to change.</li>
                <li>Values: Each specified property is given a value, which indicates how you want to change those stylistic
                  features (e.g. what you want to change the font, width or background color to.)</li>
              </ul>


              A property paired with a value is called a CSS declaration. CSS declarations are put within CSS Declaration Blocks. And finally,
              CSS declaration blocks are paired with selectors to produce CSS Rulesets (or CSS Rules). <br>              Setting
              CSS properties to specific values is the core function of the CSS language. The CSS engine calculates which
              declarations apply to every single element of a page in order to appropriately lay it out and style it. What
              is important to remember is that both properties and values are case-sensitive in CSS. The property and value
              in each pair is separated by a colon (:).<br> There are more than 300 different properties in CSS and nearly
              an infinite number of different values. Not all pairs of properties and values are allowed; each property has
              a specific list of valid values defined for it.<br><br> Declarations are grouped in blocks, with each set of
              declarations being wrapped by an opening curly brace, ({) and a closing one (}). Each declaration contained
              inside a declaration block has to be separated by a semi-colon (;), otherwise the code won't work (or will
              at least give unexpected results.) The last declaration of a block doesn't need to be terminated by a semi-colon,
              though it is often considered good style to do so as it prevents forgetting to add it when extending the block
              with another declaration.

              We are missing one part of the puzzle — we need to discuss how to tell our declaration blocks which elements they should
              be applied to. This is done by prefixing each declaration block with a <b>selector</b> — a pattern
              that matches some elements on the page. The associated declarations will be applied to those elements only.
              The selector plus the declaration block is called a <b> ruleset</b>, or often simply just a <b>rule</b>. <br>              <br>              Selectors
              can get very complicated — you can make a rule match multiple elements by including multiple selectors separated
              by commas (a group,) and selectors can be chained together, for example I want to select any element with a
              class of "blah", but only if it is inside an <span class="tags">&lt;article&gt;</span> element, and only while
              it is being hovered by the mouse pointer. Don't worry — things will become clearer as you become more experienced
              with CSS, and we'll explain selectors in great detail in the next article, Selectors. <br><br> An element may
              be matched by several selectors, therefore several rules may set a given property multiple times. CSS defines
              which one has precedence over the others and must be applied: this is called the cascade algorithm, and you'll
              learn more about how it works in Cascade and inheritance.
              <span class="secondary-title">Css statements</span>
              CSS Rules are the main building blocks of a style sheet — the most common block you'll see in CSS. But there are other types
              of block that you'll come across occasionally — CSS rules are one type of so-called CSS statements. The other
              types are as follows:
              <ul>
                <li><b>At-rules</b> are used in CSS to convey metadata, conditional information, or other descriptive information.
                  They start with an at sign (@), followed by an identifier to say what kind of rule it is, then a syntax
                  block of some kind, ending with a semi-colon (;). Each type of at-rule, defined by the identifier, will
                  have its own internal syntax and semantics. Examples include:
                  <ul>
                    <li>@charset and @import (metadata)</li>
                    <li>@media or @document (conditional information, also called nested statements, see below.)</li>
                    <li>@font-face (descriptive information)</li>
                  </ul>

                  <span class="doc-card__snippet
                  "><code>
                      @import 'custom.css';
                  </code></span>
                  This at-rule imports another CSS file into the current CSS.
                </li>
                <li><b> Nested statements</b> are a specific subset of at-rule, the syntax of which is a nested block of
                  CSS rules that will only be applied to the document if a specific condition is matched:
                  <ul>
                    <li>he @media at-rule content is applied only if the device which runs the browser matches the expressed
                      condition;
                    </li>
                    <li>the @supports at-rule content is applied only if the browser actually supports the tested feature;</li>
                    <li>the @document at-rule content is applied only if the current page matches some conditions.</li>
                  </ul>
                  Specific syntax example:
                  <span class="doc-card__snippet"><code>
                      @media (min-width: 801px) { <br>
                        &nbsp; body { <br>
                         &nbsp; &nbsp; margin: 0 auto; <br>
                         &nbsp; &nbsp; margin: 0 auto; <br>
                         &nbsp; &nbsp; width: 800px; <br>
                         &nbsp; &nbsp;  } <br>
                      }
                  </code></span>
                  The above nested statement only applies the nested rule when the page's width exceeds 800 pixels.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

              <span class="secondary-title">Make CSS readable</span>
              As you can see, CSS syntax is not that hard to write: you write some rules and if you write them wrong, they will just be
              ignored. However, even if that works, there are some best practices worth knowing to make your CSS code easier
              to use and maintain.
              <span class="secondary-title">White spaces</span>
              In the same manner as HTML, the browser tends to ignore much of the whitespace inside your CSS; a lot of the whitespace is
              just there to aid readability.In our first example below we have each declaration (and rule start/end) on its
              own line — this is arguably a good way to write CSS, as it makes it easy to maintain and understand:

              <span class="doc-card__snippet"><code>
    body { <br>
     &nbsp; font: 1em/150% Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; <br>
     &nbsp; padding: 1em; <br>
     &nbsp; margin: 0 auto; <br>
     &nbsp; max-width: 33em; <br>
    } <br> <br>
    
    @media (min-width: 70em) { <br>
      &nbsp;  body { <br>
        &nbsp;   font-size: 130%; <br>
        &nbsp; } <br>
    } <br>
    <br> <br>
    h1 { <br>
      &nbsp; font-size: 1.5em; <br>
    } <br> <br>
    
    div p, #id:first-line { <br>
      &nbsp;  background-color: red; <br>
      &nbsp;  background-style: none <br>
    } <br>
    <br>
    div p { <br>
      &nbsp;  margin: 0; <br>
      &nbsp;  padding: 1em; <br>
    } <br> <br>
    
    div p + p { <br>
      &nbsp; padding-top: 0; <br>
    } <br>
</code></span>
              You could write exactly the same CSS like so, with most of the whitespace removed — this is functionally identical to the
              first example, but I'm sure you'll agree that it is somewhat harder to read:
              <span class="doc-card__snippet"><code>
    body {font: 1em/150% Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; padding: 1em; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 33em;} <br>
    @media (min-width: 70em) { body {font-size: 130%;} } <br> <br>
    
    h1 {font-size: 1.5em;} <br> <br>
    div p, #id:first-line {background-color: red; background-style: none} <br>
    div p {margin: 0; padding: 1em;} <br>
    div p + p {padding-top: 0;}
</code></span>
              The code layout you choose is usually a personal preference, although when you start to work in teams, you may find that
              the existing team has its own styleguide that specifies an agreed convention to follow. <br><br>              The
              whitespace you do need to be careful of in CSS is the whitespace around the properties and their values. For
              example, the following is valid CSS:
              <span class="doc-card__snippet"><code>
                  margin: 0 auto; <br>
                  padding-left: 10px;
              </code></span>
              But the following is invalid:
              <span class="doc-card__snippet"><code>
                  margin: 0auto; <br>
                  padding- left: 10px;
              </code></span>
              Because <span class="tags">0auto </span> is not recognised as a valid value for the margin property (<span
                class="tags">0</span> and <span class="tags">auto</span> are two separate values,) and the browser does not
              recognise <span class="tags"> padding-</span> as a valid property. So you should always make sure to separate
              distinct values from one another by at least a space, but keep property names/values together as one unbroken
              string.
              <span class="secondary-title">Comments</span>
              As with HTML, you are encouraged to make comments in your CSS, to help you understand how your code works when coming back
              to it after several months, and to help others understand it. Comments are also useful for temporarily commenting
              out certain parts of the code for testing purposes, for example if you are trying to find which part of your
              code is causing an error. <br> <br> Comments in CSS begin with <span class="tags">/*</span> and
              end with <span class="tags">*/</span> .
